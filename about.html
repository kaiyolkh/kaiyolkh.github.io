          <p>
            I was born in Hong Kong and moved to Canada in 2012. For the most part of my life I've known to others as social and talkative. As a kid I enjoyed reading maps and drawing buildings, maps, and bridges. I had once thought about becoming an architect, but interests have shifted as I grew up and explored more things. I'm interested in technology, so at some point I thought I would enjoy computer science or software engineering, but then I find myself more interested in TPM as it better aligns with my skills and interests which I have accumulated and developed over the years.

            I enjoy photography, swimming, and spending time with friends. I have a curious personality and I occasionally chase sunsets too! During my free time I like to research and catch up with tech news on new products, hardware, services, and also learn about UX in tech and transit. Occasionally I would also learn about architecture, geography, science, history and geopolitics.

            I chase for work-life balance and believe we should always take the opportunities to live life to the fullest. I'm currently working on a group project for University of Toronto’s course Computer Science CSC396 – Designing Systems for Real World Problems, to propose a solution to to improve students’ lives by addressing the challenges they face in accessing third spaces, as well as the key causes and stressors that contribute to work-life imbalance.

            One game that I couldn't stop playing is Minecraft, as it is a sandbox game that gives you all the freedoms to do whatever you want in game. I like this game because it aligns with my philosophy to always stay true to yourself and follow your heart no matter what you do.
